# CSS In-Depth, v2

## Why?
I personally have some cheat sheets and favorite articles I use as CSS references from time to time. I want to put together a repo to house these notes and new found skills I found in a class by Estelle Weyl. [Check her out!](https://github.com/estelle). If you find these helpful, use them! Enjoy. 

## Course Notes
In this course, Estelle Weyl (Standardista) shows you the full capabilities of CSS3. Deep-dive into the essential features of CSS, while also exploring new CSS features you probably didn't know existed. Learn CSS Selectors and Specificity, style web forms, learn visual effects like gradients, transforms, animations and transitions, use Flexbox and CSS Grid... and more!

This course and others like it are available as part of our Frontend Masters video subscription.
